## About Me
I'm a third year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA. I like all things EE, but I specialize in Signal Processing, Most of what you see here are passion projects, some of which I haven't had time to work on since college started, but I'm always looking to learn more and work on fun stuff. To learn more about me, check out my [website](https://sanjitsarda.com/).
