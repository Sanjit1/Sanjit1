I'm a third year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA. I like *most* things EE(not u, semiconductors), but I specialize in Signal Processing and Optimization. 

If you are looking to learn more about me, check out my [website](https://sanjitsarda.com/). I have *some* information about my projects there, but I never update that website properly, so you are better off looking at my [GitHub](https://github.com/Sanjit1).

I am happy to talk to people, so feel free to reach out. Also join [IEEE at UCLA](https://discord.gg/UHjbHfpw76), we are cool.
